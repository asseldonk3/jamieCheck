    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A returns more directly relevant electric bikes in the top results and places higher-quality, full-size city and fatbikes prominently. The top positions in A include recognizable adult electric models (Puch, Vogue, Diabolo) whereas B places more non-bicycle items (kitchen appliances, corkscrew) among the top slots, reducing immediate query relevance. Overall A gives better user value by surfacing meaningful electric-bike options earlier and showing a clearer variety of bike types.",
    "key_differences": "A prioritizes full-size electric bikes and bike-relevant variants in the top results; B surfaces more non-bike items and small/novelty items higher, creating noise and lower immediate relevance.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Within the visible page there are repeated product images elsewhere (the same bike images appear multiple times further down the grid across different sellers), but none of the first 8 items in either view use identical product photos. Duplicates are present beyond the top-8 positions (e.g., some Vogue and Diabolo listings repeat later).",
