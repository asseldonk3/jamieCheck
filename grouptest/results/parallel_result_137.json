    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A surfaces a broader set of full scooters among the top results (off-road scooter, compact Xiaomi models, a 3‑wheel mobility scooter) so the top results are more relevant to a generic 'scooters' query. Algorithm B does show a strong consumer scooter (Xiaomi 4 Lite) at #1, but B places several spare parts/accessory items much higher (positions 3–4) which reduces immediate relevance and user value for shoppers expecting scooters rather than components.",
    "key_differences": "A prioritizes complete scooter products and presents more product-type variety in the top slots; B elevates spare parts/controllers earlier and therefore has lower immediate relevance and user value despite having a popular scooter at #1.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No identical product images were repeated within the first 8 items of either screenshot. (There are repeated model images elsewhere on the page, but not inside the top-8 view for either A or B.)",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
