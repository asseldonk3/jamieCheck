    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Ignoring duplicate images, A presents a more focused set of results for the query 'Fiets met dikke / brede banden' — the top slots are occupied by fatbikes / e-fatbikes (ENGWE models, Diablo, QM Wheels) which directly match the intent of wide/ thick-tyre bicycles. Top listings in A are relevant and show popular models and clear e-bike/fatbike options first. B still surfaces relevant fatbikes but mixes in more non-fat models (children’s bikes, a regular mountain/hybrid) higher up, making it slightly less targeted for the specific query.",
    "key_differences": "A is more concentrated on fatbikes/e-fatbikes in the top positions (higher immediate relevance). B is slightly more diverse (children’s bikes, mountain/hybrid appear earlier) but that reduces relevance for this specific query.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Both pages repeat the ENGWE E26 product image (blue version appears twice in each screenshot; the black ENGWE image appears twice within A's first 8). Duplicates reduce perceived variety — A had two extra identical images among the first 8, B had one.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 1 duplicates"
