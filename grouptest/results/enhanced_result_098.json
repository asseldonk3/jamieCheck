  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Version B ranks actual electric bikes higher and shows a broader, more useful mix of bike models and sellers for the query “Sparta Elektrische fietsen.” Version A places a non-bike Sparta-branded cover image in the top positions (and repeats it), which reduces relevance and wastes prime slots. B surfaces more distinct bike models, clearer price/quality cues (badges, discounts) and fewer irrelevant repeats, giving users faster access to relevant options.",
    "key_differences": "A has a prominent duplicate (Sparta cover) occupying top slots and shows less immediately relevant items; B reduces duplicates in the top results and surfaces more distinct bike models, improving relevance and diversity.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A the Sparta cover image appears twice in the top results (identical photo occupying two slots). B shows no identical images within the first 8. Some repeated model images appear further down the page but not within the first 8 in B.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
