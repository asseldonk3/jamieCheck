  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Version B presents a slightly stronger result set for the query \"Ortlieb Fietstassen\": the top results are highly relevant (well-known Ortlieb models are shown), the result set in B contains a wider spread of different Ortlieb models and styles among the highest-ranked items (different shapes and use-cases), and the top positions in B include clear bestseller/quality signals and a mix of price points which improves user value. A is relevant as well but its top results feel less balanced across model types and price/feature variations compared with B.",
    "key_differences": "B surfaces a broader variety of Ortlieb models and more useful top-positions (different form-factors, clearer bestseller/quality cues and a better spread of price points). A tends to cluster similar product types higher up, reducing immediate exposure to other popular Ortlieb models.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A the yellow Ortlieb Sport-Roller image appears multiple times in the top 8 (same product photo repeated) and the red Back-Roller style also repeats. In B there are still some repeated Ortlieb images but fewer in the first 8; repeats mainly involve the yellow Sport-Roller and a common black Back-Roller photo.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 3 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
