  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Version B ranks more relevant, full-featured 220V through-flow heaters higher (a grey/black 220V style unit appears at the top), whereas A surfaces smaller point-of-use heaters first. B shows better variety in the top results (mix of proper in-line heaters, branded panels and faucet units) and fewer repeated images among the top items, so users see more distinct options and are more likely to find a suitable 220V sanitair doorstroomer quickly. Overall B provides higher-quality top results and slightly better user value.",
    "key_differences": "B places more appropriate/robust 220V flow heaters higher and avoids repeating the same product image as often in the top slots; A shows more repetition of the small white shower-heater image near the top, reducing diversity and discovery.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A the small white shower/heater image appears three times among the first 8 (counted as 2 duplicate occurrences). B still has a repeated small shower-heater image but less repetition in the top 8. There are visually similar grey/black panel images, but they are not identical image files in the top-8 and were treated as unique.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 1 duplicates"
