  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm B returns more directly relevant single (enkele) bike bags up top, matching the query intent. B's top results are focused on single panniers with clearer product photos and recognizable brands, whereas A surfaces many double panniers and backpacks in the highest positions, reducing immediate relevance for someone searching specifically for an 'enkele fietstas'. B also offers better variety of single-bag styles in the top results, improving user choice and likely user satisfaction.",
    "key_differences": "B emphasizes single panniers (higher relevance to 'enkele') and places better single-bag options near the top. A shows more double panniers and backpacks early, reducing relevance and top-result quality.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Most identical product images appear elsewhere on the page (same products from different sellers), but within the first 8 results of each version there are no exact-image duplicates. Several products (Anroc double, JONSKA double, Ortlieb Back-Roller) appear on both pages but not repeated among the top 8 of either ranking.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
