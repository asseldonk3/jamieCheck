    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Both results sets are relevant to the query 'Douchebak 180x80' and surface the expected shower trays, but B produces a slightly better ranking quality. B places a visibly different model (the long rectangular Xenz Mariana style tray) higher in the list, giving stronger immediate coverage of distinct 180x80 options. A shows several visually identical items clustered near the top which reduces perceived variety. Overall B provides better top-result variety and an earlier presentation of a clear 180x80 model, which improves user value for someone scanning for that specific size.",
    "key_differences": "B displays more variety in the first results (mixing a rectangular model among angled composite trays), while A clusters identical angled composite tray photos together near the top. Bâ€™s ordering gives users quicker access to different product models (and likely different sellers/prices), whereas A emphasizes the same visual product repeatedly.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In both pages the same angled composite shower-tray images (one light/white texture and one black textured) repeat multiple times within the first 8 results (each appears 3 times). There are also one long rectangular tray image and one lifestyle scene that are unique among the top 8. Repeated identical product photos from different sellers reduce visual diversity in the listings.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 4 duplicates, B has 4 duplicates"
