  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Version A shows more relevant and varied top results for the query 'Sifon met Beluchter Sanitair'. The top positions include different product types (Uâ€‘bend siphon, vent cap, chrome fitting, beaker trap) which better covers likely user intents. A surfaces useful items and price/merchant variety early, whereas B repeats the same product photos more frequently near the top, reducing diversity and likely making it harder for users to find the exact variant they want.",
    "key_differences": "Main difference is diversity vs. duplication: A presents a broader mix of relevant product types in its top results; B clusters identical product images (same McAlpine siphon and the same 'pink badge' variant) multiple times, reducing informational value of the top results.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Both pages repeat the same McAlpine U-bend product image multiple times in the first 8 results. A has three instances of that identical U-bend image among the top 8. B repeats that U-bend three times and also repeats the same pink-badged universal sifon image twice, causing 5 of the top 8 to be non-unique images.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 3 duplicates, B has 5 duplicates"
