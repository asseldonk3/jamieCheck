  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Search results B are more tightly focused on 'douchestang zonder boren' (tension/telescopic and corner shower rods) in the top positions — the top results are clearly rod products and relevant to the query. The images in B emphasize product details (end caps, telescopic bars, corner rods) that help users quickly recognise no‑drill solutions. Overall B surfaces relevant rod types (straight, corner, telescopic) higher than A, which places some less directly relevant items (e.g. a shower curtain) among the first results.",
    "key_differences": "B prioritises direct, clearly identifiable no‑drill rods and product detail shots up front, improving immediate relevance. A shows more varied installed-room lifestyle shots and comparison links but also surfaces at least one non-rod item within the top results, reducing immediate relevance.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A the main duplicate is the same installed Erica corner-rod image appearing twice within the first 8. In B there are multiple repeated product images in the first 8 (notably the same straight black telescopic bar photo appears twice and the same tiled corner-rod image appears twice), which reduces visual variety. Several manufacturers/stock images (e.g. black end-cap close-ups, Neptun image) appear across both lists.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 4 duplicates"
