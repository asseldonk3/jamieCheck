    "reasoning": "Version A presents a slightly stronger ranking for the query. Top results are visually clear, show full-product photos and include a mix of recognizable/complete e‑MTB and e‑hybrid models that are relevant to 'Elektrische mountainbikes / e‑mountainbikes / e‑MTBs'. The page shows good product variety across frame styles (fatbike, hybrid, hardtail/MTB, step‑through) and includes several mid‑ to higher‑quality offerings up front, which increases user value for shoppers looking for e‑MTBs. Overall A feels better balanced between relevance and product quality.",
    "key_differences": "A emphasizes full-product images and a broader mix of frame styles and perceived product quality in the top slots. B places some less-informative images (close-up / cropped views) and lower perceived variety higher on the page, reducing immediate clarity for the shopper.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Both screens show repeated identical product photos of the same ENGWE E26 fatbike image appearing multiple times among the top eight tiles. Duplicates are concentrated among the ENGWE/fatbike listings; B also contains a small number of cropped/close-up images (battery) that reduce clarity but are not counted as duplicates.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
