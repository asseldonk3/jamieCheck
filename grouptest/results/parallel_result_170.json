    "reasoning": "Algorithm A surfaces multiple clearly age-appropriate children’s bikes with training wheels (including 14\" variants) near the top and shows a broader mix of styles and brands. The top results in A feel more relevant to the query “Kinderfiets met Zijwieltjes 4 Jaar” (targeting bikes suitable for ~4 years). Algorithm B over-emphasizes repeated listings of the same model family (SJOEF/AMIGO/PROMETHEUS variants) and places a 16\" model at the very top (potentially less appropriate for 4-year-olds), reducing immediate relevance and perceived diversity.",
    "key_differences": "A provides better balance between relevance and variety: it promotes several 14\"/child-oriented bikes and different brands in the top results. B clusters multiple variants of the same model family and shows less size-appropriate prioritization (16\" high in rank), making the top results less tailored to the query.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Visually identical manufacturer images are reused across multiple listings (notably the SJOEF Dolly image appears for 12\"/14\"/16\" variants). However those represent different sizes/variants, so per instructions they were not counted as duplicates. Overall many repeated brand images occur but they represent different size/model listings rather than duplicate-seller copies.",
