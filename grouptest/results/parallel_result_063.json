  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Version B produces more relevant and useful rankings for the query 'Heren Elektrische fietsen'. The top results in B are primarily bikes (various models and types), whereas A surfaces several non-bike items (an e-bike display unit and a kitchen juicer) in the top positions, which reduces relevance. B shows better product variety across brands and types in the top positions and places more clearly bike-related items higher, improving immediate user value and likely matching shopper intent better.",
    "key_differences": "A surfaces irrelevant products (accessory and a household appliance) among the top tiles and repeats the same models more aggressively, reducing perceived variety. B keeps mostly bikes in top positions, offers a broader set of bike models and types, and therefore provides better relevance and user value.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Both sets show duplicate product images in the top 8: the ENGWE E26 (blue) appears multiple times and the Elops/Decathlon city bike image appears twice. Duplicates come from multiple sellers listing the identical product image and reduce visible diversity by occupying multiple slots.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
