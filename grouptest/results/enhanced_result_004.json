  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A returns more bike-focused results at the top (multiple e-bikes, city bikes and popular models), which better matches the query 'Fietsen'. Top results in A surface relevant, high-value items (e-bikes, recognizable models and visible deals) that a typical shopper searching for bikes would expect. Algorithm B shows more accessories (locks, tires, sensors) and a less bike-centric mix in the top slots, which reduces relevance for the broad query.",
    "key_differences": "A prioritizes actual bikes and prominent bike models/deals in top positions (higher relevance). B produces greater product-type diversity (accessories included) but at the cost of query relevance and perceived top-result quality.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A the Vogue Mestengo bike image appears twice within the first 8 items (repeat listing). Otherwise the first 8 in both pages show mostly unique photos; B's top 8 contain no exact identical images. Some identical helmet and bike images appear across the two pages but not duplicated within B's top 8.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 1 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
