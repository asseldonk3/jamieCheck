    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both pages return relevant results for the query 'Wastafels', but version B places more mainstream/popular models and recognised brands (Villeroy & Boch, Laufen, Geberit) and a broader set of sink types (single, double, wall-mounted, long washbasins) higher in the listing. Top results in B are more useful to a generic shopper because they surface familiar brands, a range of form factors and clear product shots early, which improves relevance and immediate user value. A shows attractive and more niche designer items but its top positions are less representative of the broader category a generic user likely expects.",
    "key_differences": "B emphasizes popular brands and a wider variety of sink types in the top results (better coverage of common user intents). A surfaces more stylistic/designer items early, which reduces representativeness and immediate user value for general searches.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact-image duplicates detected within the first 8 results on either page. Some identical images (e.g., the Burgbad double sink, long white double basins, and the beige square/stone basin) appear across the two screenshots overall, but they do not create duplicate entries within the first 8 items of either version.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
