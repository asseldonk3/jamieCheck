  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A returns more relevant, on-topic results for the query 'Anti-lek banden' (well-known puncture-resistant models like Schwalbe Marathon and CST Breaker appear high). The top results in A are higher quality and more useful to users (recognised anti-puncture models, good visibility of price/badges). Algorithm B contains a non-tire item (pump hose) in the top results and mixes in some less relevant items, reducing precision and immediate user value.",
    "key_differences": "A prioritises recognised anti-puncture tyre models and presents stronger top results; B shows noisier top positions (including an irrelevant pump hose) and less consistent relevance/quality.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A one image (a vertical smooth Schwalbe Marathon-style tyre) appears twice within the first 8 results (same product image from different sellers). No identical-image duplicates were observed among the first 8 in B.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 1 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
