    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both result sets are relevant to the query 'WC-bril', but B surfaces a better mix of mainstream, recognizable toilet-seat models and useful cues (discount badges, 'new' labels) higher in the results. B's top results prioritize popular designs and clear product shots that are likely to match typical user intent (replacement or popular brand seats). A shows relevant items but includes niche items (e.g. raised seat) and some less-helpful ordering; the top positions feel less focused on mainstream user needs.",
    "key_differences": "B places mainstream brand models and clear value signals (discounts, badges, 'Nieuw') higher, improving immediate user value. A includes more varied item types earlier (e.g. a raised toilet seat) which reduces topical concentration in the very top results.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Within the first 8 items of each screenshot there are no exact identical product images. Some product images (e.g. the Deeline closed-seat photo, Cornat and Duravit product photos) appear elsewhere on the page(s) across the two views and further down the listings, indicating the same item is offered by multiple sellers, but these repeats are not present more than once inside the top 8 of either ranking.",
