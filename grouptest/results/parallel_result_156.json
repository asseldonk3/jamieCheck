    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm B produces a more focused, tyre-centric set of results for the query 'Hema Buitenbanden' and presents higher-quality top results (recognizable tyre models, consistent tyre imagery, and visible price/offer info). Algorithm A returns a more mixed set including clearly unrelated items (e.g. V-belts, a wooden ring) and lower-relevance items in the top positions, which reduces relevance and user value. B also surfaces more recognizable popular tyre models and listings that are likely better for users looking to compare tyres and prices.",
    "key_differences": "B is more focused on actual bicycle tyres in the top positions with clearer, higher-quality tyre images and best-seller cues; A shows greater noise (non-tyre products) and less relevance at the top. B therefore offers better immediate relevance and shopping value.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Algorithm B repeats the same product images for Schwalbe tyres â€” I observed two distinct image duplicates within the first 8 (a curved grey road-tyre image and a vertical black tyre image reused). Algorithm A's top-8 contains no identical images repeated, but it includes several non-tyre items which hurt relevance.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
