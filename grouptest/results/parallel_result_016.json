    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.82,
    "reasoning": "Version A surfaces a better mix of relevant double panniers for the query “Fietstassen Dubbel 50 liter”: it puts several waterproof roll-top and popular/best-seller models high in the listing, offers a good spread of styles (rolltop, classic pannier, waterproof urban), and shows competitive prices and recognizable models near the top. Results in A feel more focused on the common user intent (durable, 50L-capable double bike bags). Version B contains the same product families but ranks some less-typical or more expensive/boxy items higher, which slightly reduces immediate relevance and perceived user value.",
    "key_differences": "A prioritizes waterproof roll-top and popular/best-seller panniers higher (better immediate relevance and perceived value). B shows a few bulkier or more expensive variants earlier and is slightly less focused on the most common 50L double pannier types.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Within the first 8 results of each version I did not find any exact identical product photos. The same product models appear multiple times elsewhere on the pages, but the first-8 images shown are all visually distinct.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
