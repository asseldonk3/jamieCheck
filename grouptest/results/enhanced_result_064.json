    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Both pages are on-topic for the query 'Douchecabines 90x90' and surface appropriate 90x90 models, but A provides a slightly stronger mix of product types and clearer value signals in the top results. The top items in A include visually distinct styles (round quarter, framed rectangular, premium-looking renders) and visible price/discount cues and comparison links that help users quickly assess deals. B is also relevant but places visually near-duplicate product images at the very top, reducing perceived variety and making it harder for users to scan different options at a glance.",
    "key_differences": "A shows more visual variety and stronger value cues in the top results; B repeats an identical product image in top positions which reduces diversity and hurts initial user exploration.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In both screenshots a black 'Linie Cadiz' line-drawing image appears twice among the first 8 results (same product image from different sellers). Aside from that the first 8 in A are mostly unique; B also repeats the Cadiz image in the top two slots, reducing top-row diversity.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
