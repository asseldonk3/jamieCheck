  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Version B presents more immediately relevant and recognizable bike-bag choices at the top (Ortlieb, Anroc, Thule) and shows a better mix of common pannier types users search for. A places smaller or niche items (small saddle/trunk bags) relatively high which is less aligned with the broad query “Fietstassen”. B therefore offers higher perceived user value and clearer relevance in the top slots.",
    "key_differences": "B prioritizes popular panniers and strong brands early (better relevance and trust signals). A surfaces smaller accessories and less typical top-of-list items first, reducing immediate relevance and perceived variety for users seeking bike bags.",
    "duplicate_notes": "I observed the same product images appearing across the two pages (e.g., the Anroc double panniers, Basil Move bag, Ortlieb panniers appear on both screenshots), but within the first 8 results of each version there were no exact-image repeats. Duplicates tend to occur beyond the top 8 and across sellers/pages rather than as repeated items inside the top-8 on either page.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
