  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Version B ranks more recognizable, higher-quality and relevant pannier products nearer the top (Vaude, Dresco, Fischer, Ortlieb/Thule appear prominently). The top results in B show better brand-quality signals and useful variety (single panniers, double panniers, backpack-style panniers) that match the query 'Fietstassen Afneembaar'. Version A contains relevant items but includes less useful items higher (e.g., a Racktime bracket) and mixes lower-value / niche items into the very top, reducing immediate user value.",
    "key_differences": "B surfaces stronger brand-name, higher-quality panniers and a clearer variety of detachable bag types near the top; A shows some irrelevant accessories and lower-value items earlier which reduces perceived relevance and top-result quality.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact identical product images were repeated within the first 8 results of either screenshot. Many of the same product images appear across the two versions (i.e., overlap between A and B), but each page's top 8 are visually unique.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
