    "reasoning": "Neither result set surfaces Riese & Müller branded accessories despite the query asking for 'Riese Und Müller Fietsaccessoires', so brand-level relevance is low for both. Both A and B surface useful, relevant generic bike accessories (well-known accessory brands like ABUS and Garmin, panniers, locks and lighting) and show price/discount information and best-seller badges, which provides user value. Top results in both sets are recognisable, purchasable accessories rather than irrelevant items, but neither prioritises Riese & Müller items or official brand-specific accessories as the query implies.",
    "key_differences": "Differences are small: A shows a slightly broader mix within the visible top items (helmets, panniers, a GPS unit and a chain lock) giving marginally more category variety at a glance; B places more helmets up front and clusters similar helmet products higher. Neither ordering offers clear brand-specific (Riese & Müller) relevance; the divergence is mostly in product-type ordering rather than relevance or quality.",
    "duplicate_notes": "I observed repeated product images elsewhere on the pages (multiple occurrences of the same ABUS helmet and repeating pannier photos lower on the pages), but within the first 8 results of each screenshot there are no identical images. Overall the page shows some duplicated images across the full listing (same item from multiple sellers), leading to repetition beyond the top visible results.",
