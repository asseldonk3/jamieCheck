    "reasoning": "Algorithm A returns more relevant items for the query 'Kinderfiets 3 Jaar' â€” mostly age-appropriate children's bicycles with clear white-background product images, visible products aimed at 3-year-olds and a variety of styles. The top results in A surface obvious kids bikes (training wheels, small frames) and visible price/compare info, which gives immediate user value. Algorithm B mixes in non-bike items (child seat, protective pads) and lifestyle shots early in the ranking, reducing relevance and utility for a user explicitly searching for a 3-year-old's bike.",
    "key_differences": "A emphasizes direct matches (kid bicycles) and a range of distinct models in the top positions. B interleaves accessories and lifestyle/child-in-photo images among the top slots, reducing relevance and harming immediate comparison/selection.",
    "duplicate_notes": "A shows one identical product image repeated among the first 8 (a white basket-style kids bike appears twice). Several items are similar models in different colors (e.g. Royal Baby variants) but those were not counted as duplicates per instructions. B had no exact identical images in its first 8 results; it does show repeated models in different colors which were not counted.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 1 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
