  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.82,
    "reasoning": "Version B surfaces more prostate-relevant saddle shapes higher in the list (cut-out / ergonomically notched saddles appear earlier) and mixes narrow/touring and comfort models more evenly. Both versions show popular comfort gel saddles and discounted items, but A emphasizes broad gel/oversized comfort saddles at the very top which is less targeted for a ‘prostaat’ (pressure-relief / center-cut) query. B therefore provides better immediate relevance and a more useful top-of-list selection for users seeking prostate-friendly saddles.",
    "key_differences": "B ranks cut-out/ergonomic saddles (higher relevance) earlier and shows better variety between touring and specialty prostate-friendly designs; A favors bulky broad gel/comfort saddles up front, reducing relevance for the specific query.",
    "duplicate_notes": "The same black gel/comfort saddle image with small green highlights and accessory icons appears multiple times (different sellers). Also a schematic/diagram style product image is reused across listings. These repeats reduce perceived variety and clutter the results.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
