  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A surfaces more clearly relevant bottle-holders up front (recognizable brands and a variety of cage styles) and shows best-seller items in top positions. A's top results include multiple distinct holder designs (mounts, traditional cages, brand-name holders) and therefore better satisfy the query intent 'E-bike Bidonhouders'. Algorithm B places a large, irrelevant battery image and some motorbike/mount-style items more prominently, which reduces immediate relevance and user value.",
    "key_differences": "A prioritizes well-known bottle-cage styles and brand listings in the top slots (better immediate relevance and useful variety). B has more off-topic or accessory items (battery, motorbike holders) ranked higher and fewer high-relevance brand items in the very top results.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Although no identical images appeared within the first 8 items on either page, identical product photos do repeat elsewhere on the pages (e.g. the SKS 'Anywhere' cage and the multi-grid 'Drink Bidonhouder' images appear multiple times across the full listing). Repeats tend to be the same seller/product shown multiple times or identical images used by different sellers; color variants are present but were not counted as duplicates per instructions.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
