  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.75,
    "reasoning": "Both rankings surface relevant shower stools but B orders slightly more practical and user-valued items higher. For the query 'IKEA Douchekruk' neither version strongly prioritises IKEA-branded models, but B places popular/adjustable stools and a clear best-seller item higher in the grid, improving immediate usefulness for shoppers. Overall relevance and diversity are similar, but B gives marginally better user value by surfacing common, lower-priced and adjustable options earlier.",
    "key_differences": "B ranks practical, adjustable and popular models (including a best-seller/adjustable stool) slightly higher, while A surfaces a mix that includes pricier/premium-looking items earlier. B therefore offers marginally better top-result quality and value for typical buyers.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact identical product images were repeated within the first 8 results of either version. Several similar-looking black or white stools appear across both pages, but they use distinct product photos in the first 8 positions.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
