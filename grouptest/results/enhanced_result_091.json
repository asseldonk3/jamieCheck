  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A surfaces relevant adult city/urban helmets prominently (well-known models/brands) and keeps the top results focused on typical user intent for 'Fietshelmen'. Top results in A are high-quality, popular urban helmets and present clear price badges and seller comparisons. Algorithm B includes more variety but places a child-pattern helmet high in the grid (3rd position) which reduces relevance for a generic search for bike helmets; overall B feels noisier in the top slots.",
    "key_differences": "A prioritizes adult/urban helmets and popular models in the top slots (better match to generic search intent). B shows slightly more visual variety but includes less relevant items (e.g., a kids-pattern helmet) near the top, lowering perceived ranking quality.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact-identical product photos were repeated within the first 8 items on either page. The same helmet models (Abus Urban 1.3/3.0 family) appear repeatedly across the page, but identical images were not present multiple times within the top 8 â€” duplicates, when present, occur further down or show different angles/colors rather than exact same photo.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
