  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A surfaces a broader and more relevant set of comfort-focused saddles for the query (memory-foam, gel and ergonomic designs) near the top, with good variety across price points and brands and clear product images suitable for quick comparison. The top results in A more closely match the user's intent of 'best saddles against saddle pain' (comfort-oriented models and gels) and include recognizable comfort-focused offers and popular items first, improving immediate user value.",
    "key_differences": "A offers better topical coverage of comfort-oriented saddle types (memory foam, gel, ergonomic cut-outs) and a wider variety of distinct models in the top slots, improving relevance and choice. B places accessory/secondary items (chamois cream, covers) and repeats the same product images near the top, reducing the diversity of unique saddle options and lowering immediate relevance and comparison value.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In B the Contec Elliptic+ image appears twice within the first 8 results and the Voltano City XXXL image appears twice as well. In A the first 8 results show unique product images; A does include one clearly irrelevant large product (a fatbike) within the grid but not a duplicate.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
