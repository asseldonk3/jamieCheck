  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A surfaces primarily full-size electric scooters and a popular kick-scooter in the top slots, which matches the user intent for 'Elektrische scooters'. The top results in A are more vehicle-focused (moped-style scooters and a common standing e-scooter), giving better immediate relevance and higher perceived utility. Algorithm B places a non-scooter accessory (a bike/scooter light) among the top 4 results, which reduces relevance for a user searching for electric scooters. Overall A presents higher-quality, more on-topic items up front and a better mix of mainstream scooter types.",
    "key_differences": "A keeps vehicle listings (mopeds and kick-scooters) in top positions and therefore feels more relevant; B interleaves accessories early, reducing topical relevance and perceived quality of top results.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact-image duplicates were observed within the first 8 results of either screenshot. Identical product photos do appear elsewhere on the page (further down) but not within the top 8 positions shown.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
