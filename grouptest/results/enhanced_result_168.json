  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A surfaces realistic, clearly-staged quarter-round (kwartrond) 90x90 product photos at the very top (e.g. a staged BWS kwartronde), which directly matches the query intent. Top results in A are visually informative and clearly show the product shape, making it easier for users to judge fit. Algorithm B puts a line-drawing / schematic and some less-helpful stock/diagram images higher in the grid, which reduces immediate relevance and visual confidence even though many items are still relevant.",
    "key_differences": "A prioritizes real, staged product photos of kwartronde cabins in top positions (higher visual relevance). B sometimes surfaces technical drawings or schematic images and less-informative photos among the top slots, reducing perceived quality despite comparable product variety.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No identical product photos were observed among the first 8 items in either screenshot. Some identical supplier images (e.g. Wiesbaden curved cabin) appear elsewhere on the pages but not duplicated within the top 8 of either version.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
