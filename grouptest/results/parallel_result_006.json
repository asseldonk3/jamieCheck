    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.86,
    "reasoning": "Version B shows a better mix of actual bicycles in the top results (city/ebike/fatbike/children's bike) and avoids surfacing non-bike accessories among the highest positions. The top rows in B are more directly relevant to the query “Fietsen”, present clearer product variety across use-cases (adult e-bikes, kids' bikes, utility fatbikes) and maintain useful price/brand representation up front. Overall the result set in B gives users quicker access to actual bicycles and a broader selection of likely intents (commuting, family, off-road) which improves perceived ranking quality and user value.",
    "key_differences": "B prioritizes actual bike products across multiple segments in the top slots (adult e-bikes, kids' bikes, city bikes) while A places a bike accessory (Bosch Purion display) high and repeats the same model image, reducing immediate variety. B therefore provides broader coverage of user intents and more useful top results.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A's first 8 results the Vogue Mestengo image appears twice (same product image from different sellers). In B's first 8 there were no exact identical product images. Similar models in different colors (ENGWE black vs ENGWE blue) were treated as distinct and not counted as duplicates.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 1 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
