  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Ignoring duplicates: Algorithm A ranks more relevant bike components (predominantly lighting and related parts) at the top, which better matches the 'Norta Fietsonderdelen' intent for bike parts. The top results in A are focused, recognizable component types (rear/front lights, reflectors) and include well-presented product images and price cues that help quick selection. Algorithm B surfaces a mix of chargers and mirrors earlier, reducing immediate relevance and variety for a user looking specifically for Norta bike parts or common replacement components.",
    "key_differences": "A presents a tighter, more onâ€‘topic set of lighting components and commonly sought parts in top positions; B mixes in less-relevant categories (chargers, accessory mirrors) sooner, decreasing perceived relevance and variety for the core query.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In B there is a clearly repeated product image (the same boxed mirror photo appears twice within the first 8 results). Across both pages there are repeated product types (red oval rear lights, chargers etc.), but only the boxed mirror image is an exact duplicate within the first 8 of B. Repeated seller listings of identical images reduce perceived variety and can hurt browsing efficiency.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 1 duplicates"
