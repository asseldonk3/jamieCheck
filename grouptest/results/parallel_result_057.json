  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "B produces more relevant and useful results for the query \"Kleine Toiletfontein Praxis\": it shows a broader mix of small wall-mounted toilet basins from different brands (including well-known names like Villeroy & Boch), a wider range of styles and price points, and generally more variety in the top results. A surfaces many items from the same brand/family up front (Diffenz), which reduces diversity and risks showing less relevant variants first. The top results in B are more clearly typical small toilet basins users expect for this query and include recognizable options that add user trust/value.",
    "key_differences": "B has greater product diversity and brand variety in the top positions, giving better coverage of likely user intents and price/quality options. A is biased toward one brand/family and shows many visually similar items early, lowering perceived relevance and variety.",
    "duplicate_notes": "A shows many visually similar items from the same brand/family (Diffenz Ribble/Ravo/etc.) but within the top 8 there are no identical product photos. B contains one exact repeated product image (Ideavit Idea.Wall appears twice among the first 8), which reduces result uniqueness.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 1 duplicates"
