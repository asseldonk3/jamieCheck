  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Search intent is 'Vogue Elektrische fietsen' (brand + category). Version B surfaces a clearer mix of distinct Vogue models in the top slots (Longtail, Mestengo, C4) and shows better product variety and perceived user value (visible popular models and a mix of price points). Version A places very similar step‑through images near the top, reducing topical variety and making it harder for users to quickly scan distinct options or find the best deal.",
    "key_differences": "B offers better top‑rank diversity (different Vogue models shown early) and higher perceived utility for users; A repeats visually similar listings in prime positions which hurts discovery and browsing efficiency.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Several identical product photos appear multiple times (same Vogue model from different sellers). Repeats are concentrated on the step‑through Mestengo/Zenda images and the Vogue Wonder longtail images, reducing visual variety in the first rows.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 3 duplicates"
