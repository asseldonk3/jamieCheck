    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Version A presents a more relevant and useful result set for the query “Verkorte Toiletpot 43 cm.” The top results in A are largely compact/wall-hung shortened toilet bowls from different brands and show a good spread of common, popular models (BWS, Royal Plaza, Duravit, Villeroy & Boch). A avoids obvious repeated listings in the visible top results which keeps variety high and increases the chance the user will quickly find an appropriate model. Version B contains a clear repeated product image within the first 8 listings (the same Boss & Wessing / Burgos image appears twice), which reduces visible variety and hurts the browsing experience. Overall A shows better diversity and higher quality of unique top matches for the query.",
    "key_differences": "Main difference is diversity at the top of the list: A surfaces distinct models/brands across the first eight results, whereas B repeats the same product image in the top eight (reducing variety). A’s top items also include recognizable popular models without visible repetition.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In version B the Boss & Wessing (Burgos) wall-hung toilet image appears twice among the first eight results. No exact duplicate images were observed among the first eight in version A. Several models/images repeat across the two pages overall, but only B shows a duplicate within its top-8 grid.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 1 duplicates"
