    "reasoning": "Algorithm A returns highly relevant Gazelle MIK panniers at the very top of the page â€” the top slots are Gazelle models (the user explicitly searched for \"Gazelle Fietstassen MIK\"), so relevance to the query is stronger. The top results in A are clear Gazelle MIK items and good quality product images, which helps users quickly find the brand and mounting system they requested. Algorithm B shows more variety of brands and unique items in the top positions (higher diversity) but places fewer Gazelle-specific results in the absolute top slots, so it is less tightly aligned with the brand-focused query.",
    "key_differences": "A prioritizes Gazelle MIK products in the top slots (higher brand/query relevance) but at the cost of repeated listings; B surfaces more varied and unique products (better diversity) but is less focused on Gazelle-first results.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A I observed two distinct Gazelle product images each appearing twice within the first 8 results (a black Gazelle model with badge and a Gazelle Deluxe flap model), resulting in 4 listings that are image-duplicates. In B the first 8 images are all unique.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 4 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
