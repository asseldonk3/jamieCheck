  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Both lists largely return relevant raised toilets, but B provides slightly better ranking quality: it surfaces a mix of full toilet units (cistern + bowl) and higher-value models higher in the list, giving users more useful options up front. A shows relevant items but repeats near-identical product photos more aggressively in the top slots, reducing immediate variety and likely making it harder for users to find distinct options quickly. Overall both could improve diversity and reduce repeated listings, but B gives better top-result variety and user value.",
    "key_differences": "B places a broader mix of product types and a premium/modern model among the first eight results, while A repeats the same bowl and the same Duoblok image multiple times within the top results. B therefore offers slightly more useful variety and better product discovery.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Both pages show the same raised-bowl product photo repeated three times in the top 8 and the Duoblok/X-Joy cistern image repeated twice â€” duplicates stem from different sellers listing the identical product image. This reduces perceived variety and clutters the top results.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 5 duplicates, B has 5 duplicates"
