    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Version B provides a more diverse and discoverable set of items across brands, sizes and price points, which helps users explore options and find alternative solutions. Although B includes a few borderline items (faucet-mounted/instant heaters and small accessories) that are not classical bulk boilers, overall the top results are varied and expose different categories and price tiers. Version A shows many very similar-looking models (same brand/style) clustered at the top; that increases apparent relevance to ‘boilers’ but reduces variety and hurts the browsing experience and discoverability. A’s top positions feel repetitive and may prioritize the same SKU(s) or same-supplier listings multiple times rather than surfacing distinct, high-value alternatives.",
    "key_differences": "A concentrates on multiple visually similar boilers (several instances of the same model/style), producing high topical precision but low diversity. B ranks a broader mix of products and price points, improving discovery and user choice, at the cost of a few slightly less relevant items (accessories/fixtures).",
    "duplicate_notes": "Screenshot A shows the same black vertical boiler image repeated within the first 8 results (the same SKU/photo appears at least twice). B's first 8 appear visually distinct with no exact image repeats. Duplicates in A reduce perceived variety and can frustrate users comparing options.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
