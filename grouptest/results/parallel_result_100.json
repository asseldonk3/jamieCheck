    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both results sets are relevant to the query 'Geberit Toiletreservoirs' and surface core Geberit cisterns, frames and spare parts. Version A presents a slightly better mix of item types (cistern frames, flush mechanisms and kits) near the top and avoids clustering visually identical frame listings as much as B. The top results in A include clear, recognizable reservoir frames and common spare parts with visible prices and comparison links, which is useful to users evaluating options. B shows relevant items too but places multiple visually-similar frame images and lifestyle/accessory images (flush plate) close together, reducing immediate user clarity and diversity in the top ranks.",
    "key_differences": "A has more variety in the immediate top results (mix of frames, valves, kits) and better distribution of popular reservoir types. B clusters identical frame images and similar spare parts higher up, reducing diversity and making it harder for users to compare distinct product types at a glance.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Most duplicates are identical Geberit in-wall frame/duofix product photos repeated by different sellers. A smaller number of identical fill-valve images also repeat. B shows a slightly higher concentration of identical frame images among the top results, lowering visual variety.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 3 duplicates"
