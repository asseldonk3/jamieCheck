    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both results show highly relevant top items (two proper wooden outdoor saunas in the very top), but B produces a slightly better overall ranking quality. B has fewer repeated images in the top results, giving more visible variety and more distinct product choices in the first view. A shows more repeated listings of the same portable steam-sauna images early in the grid which reduces perceived variety and makes it harder for a user to compare alternatives quickly. Top-result relevance is similar (cabins are ranked high in both), but Bâ€™s ordering and diversity deliver more user value.",
    "key_differences": "B has better item variety and fewer identical product images in the first 8, improving browse diversity; A repeats the same portable sauna images (red tent and quilted cube) multiple times near the top which harms perceived selection.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Most duplicates are the same portable steam-sauna product photos (red foldable tent and the brown quilted box) showing multiple times from different sellers. A has two duplicate extra occurrences in the first 8, B has one.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 1 duplicates"
