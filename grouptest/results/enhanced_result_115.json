    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both lists show relevant small washbasins for the query 'Kleine Fonteintjes', but B produces a slightly better ranking mix. B surfaces a broader variety of shapes and materials in the top slots (stone, wood/open-shelf, concrete, metal) and avoids showing the same product image twice among the first eight. A starts with a highly relevant small white wall-mounted basin but repeats that identical image within the top results, which reduces perceived variety and utility. B therefore gives users more distinct choices up-front and a better balance between niche / decorative options and straightforward small basins.",
    "key_differences": "A places a very relevant small white basin first but repeats that exact product image within the top 8, reducing diversity. B keeps the top 8 visually distinct (more material/shape variety) so users see more unique options immediately.",
    "duplicate_notes": "A shows the same white Clou/InBe small wall basin image twice within the first 8 results (reducing variety). Other similar models (concrete/black-stand basins and wooden open-shelf units) appear across both lists but are not repeated within B's top 8.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 1 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
