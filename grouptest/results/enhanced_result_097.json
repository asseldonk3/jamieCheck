    "reasoning": "Both lists are highly relevant for the query 'Keukenkranen' and show common kitchen-faucet types (single-lever, spring/pre-rinse, wall-mounted, Quooker-style). Version B slightly edges out A because it surfaces a clear best-seller/cheap option at the top, shows a broader visual mix (including a lifestyle image) and places several mainstream/recognizable models (and good discounts) earlier — which improves perceived user value and clickability. A is relevant and shows big, eye-catching products (e.g., the spring/pre-rinse model) but B’s ordering better balances popularity, deals and recognizability in the top positions.",
    "key_differences": "B surfaces a clear best-seller/cheap popular item earlier and includes a lifestyle/context image that improves recognition; A gives more prominence to a large spring/pre-rinse model. B has slightly better mix of popular brands and visible deals in the very top results, improving likely click-through and purchase intent.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In B the wall-mounted double-handle chrome faucet image appears twice within the top 8 (same photo used by different sellers). No identical product images were repeated within the top 8 of A. Several identical images are shared across the two lists (same items from different sellers) but only B shows an internal duplicate among its first 8.",
