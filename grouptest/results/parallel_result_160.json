    "reasoning": "Version A provides a slightly better ranking for the query. Top results are relevant (a range of inflatable baths, loungers and small tubs), the first page shows more product variety (different shapes, sizes and use-cases) and surfaces distinct brands and styles in the prime positions. The top results in A balance recognisable best-sellers, different form-factors and clearly priced offers, which improves user value for users comparing options. Version B contains many relevant items too but places very similar/near-duplicate items higher up which reduces perceived variety and makes discovery and comparison harder.",
    "key_differences": "A shows greater product diversity and a cleaner spread of distinct items in the top results; B repeats the same product image(s) in the top results which reduces variety and hurts exploration and comparison.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In B there are multiple occurrences of the same black round 'Fleau' style tub image within the first eight results (the Fleau product appears repeatedly). A shows no identical product images among its first eight results â€” images appear unique and varied.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 3 duplicates"
