    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A surfaces highly relevant men’s helmets (many popular Abus urban models and best‑seller items) at the top, shows a good spread of price points and visible discounts, and keeps primarily adult/commuter helmets in the top slots. Algorithm B includes a clearly irrelevant children’s/’smiley’ helmet among the first results and a very high‑end Giro appears early (less helpful for a generic ‘Heren Fietshelmen’ query), reducing perceived relevance and user value.",
    "key_differences": "A favors popular urban/commuter men’s helmets and sale/best‑seller items up front (better relevance and immediate user value). B has more visual variety but injects irrelevant items (kids helmet) and niche/high‑end models early, lowering overall relevance for a general men’s helmet search.",
    "duplicate_notes": "A shows one repeated product image in the top 8 (the beige Purl‑Y appears twice). Overall both pages heavily feature the same few Abus models across sellers, but B’s top 8 shows no exact image duplicates while A has one exact image repeat.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
