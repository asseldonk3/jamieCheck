  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A presents a more diverse and relevant set of 'Fontein Wc Wastafels' in the top results: different shapes, materials and form factors are surfaced without immediate repetition. The top items in A are visually distinct and cover common user intents (compact wall-mounted, stone, cabinet-mounted). Algorithm B shows a clear duplicate image taking two of the top slots (concrete/toilet-fontein), reducing variety and making the top results less useful for quick browsing.",
    "key_differences": "A offers better visual variety and more useful top results for discovery; B suffers from an identical image repeated in the top positions which reduces diversity and likely user value.",
    "duplicate_notes": "B has the same concrete/’Toilet Fontein Beton’ image displayed twice in the first 8 positions (adjacent). Several products (Clou InBe, open-shelf wooden sink, beige Ora, black-frame sink, hardsteen sink) appear on both pages (different rankings), indicating the marketplace has multiple sellers for identical items; only B shows an immediate duplicated image among its top 8.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 1 duplicates"
