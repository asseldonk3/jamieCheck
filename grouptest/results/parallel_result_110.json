    "reasoning": "Both result lists are broadly relevant to the query \"Fietsonderdelen\" (bike parts) and surface common categories (tyres, chargers, lights, saddles, chain guards). Version B edges out A because its top row shows slightly better variety and higher user-value items up front (a best‑seller tyre, then an e-bike charger, a recognizable bike light product, and a chain guard). B places a useful light and a mix of utility parts higher in the grid, improving the chance that a generic parts shopper finds a desirable item quickly. A still shows relevant items but feels a bit more concentrated on tyres/chargers and includes some less immediately useful items in the very top slots.",
    "key_differences": "B offers marginally better top‑result diversity (tyre + charger + bike light + chain guard) and surfaces a high‑value light product earlier; A emphasizes tyres and chargers in the top slots and has fewer distinct product types among the first row.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Duplicate patterns are limited in the visible top results. A shows unique images across the first 8 items. B contains one apparent repeated charger image among the first 8 (multiple sellers using the same product photo). Outside the first 8 there are additional repeated tyre and charger images across the pages.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 1 duplicates"
