  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Ignoring duplicate-image occurrences: Version B presents a slightly better mix of bidet-specific items and toilets near the top â€” it surfaces bidet attachments, handheld sprayers and a dedicated bidet/toilet seat among the first results, which is more directly relevant to the query \"Bidet wc / toilet\". B also shows a broader range of price points and product types (accessories + full toilets) in the top slots, improving choice for different shoppers. A tends to foreground full stand-alone toilets higher, which is reasonable for the query but gives less immediate coverage of popular bidet accessories and lower-priced options.",
    "key_differences": "B balances accessories (sprayers, hoses) and bidet seats with toilets earlier, giving more immediate relevance to users seeking bidet solutions. A emphasizes full toilets up front and shows less variety in product type and price spread in the top positions.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A's top 8 the same white 'LARA' toilet product image appears twice (same image from different sellers). B's first 8 show no exact image repeats. Across both screenshots there are many similar product photos (bidet sprayers, hoses, white toilets) shared between sellers, but exact identical-image duplication within the top-8 occurs only in A.",
