  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Version B provides slightly better top-of-page relevance and variety for the query 'Elektrische fietsen Lage instap'. The top results in B surface a broader mix of practical city/low-step models and styles (city e-bikes and compact commuter models) and show clearer deal/badge signals, which increases user value. Overall the ordering in B feels more balanced between popular models and different use cases, giving users quicker access to likely relevant choices.",
    "key_differences": "B shows more varied product types and price points within the first page and places a broader set of brands/models higher. A is more focused on the same popular model(s) repeated near the top, which reduces visible variety. B therefore exposes alternative choices and badges/deals earlier, improving discovery.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Most duplicates are repeated ENGWE E26 product images (same fatbike/step-through photo across different sellers). The Vogue Premium city bike image also appears more than once. These repeats occupy multiple top slots and reduce perceived variety.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 3 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
