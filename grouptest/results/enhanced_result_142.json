  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Both result sets are relevant to the query (foldable shower chairs). Version B orders a broader mix of product types (wall-mounted fold-down seats, 4-legged shower chairs and in-situ mounted examples) higher in the grid, improving immediate product discovery. The top results in B show a clearer spread of form factors and price points which is more useful to users evaluating options; A surfaces relevant items but clusters similar models near the top and feels slightly less varied.",
    "key_differences": "B presents more visible product variety among the top slots (different mounting types and styles), while A places several very similar chair models (and the same model twice) nearer the top which reduces perceived diversity and exploration value.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In both screenshots the same Aidapt chair image appears twice within the first 8 results. Otherwise the first 8 images are unique; duplicates reduce visible variety in the top results for both variants.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 1 duplicates, B has 1 duplicates"
