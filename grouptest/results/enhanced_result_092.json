  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Ignoring duplicate occurrences, version B shows a tighter, more relevant set of bicycle mirrors for the query (various bar-end, handlebar and compact mirrors, visible discount/best-seller cues) and surface-level product types a shopper would expect. Version A contains a few non-relevant or low-quality top images (an unrelated decorative heart image and an adapter-looking image) which lowers the perceived relevance and top-result quality.",
    "key_differences": "B places common consumer mirror types and clearly photographed products higher (bar-end, compact handlebar mirrors, discount labels), improving immediate shopping usefulness. A shows more visual noise and at least one clearly irrelevant image in the top results, reducing perceived result quality and variety despite having no duplicate photos in the sampled set.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In the first 8 results B contains two image duplicates appearing twice each (the boxed flexible mirror listing and a bar-end mirror listing), reducing visible variety. A's first 8 are all visually distinct but include at least one irrelevant/non-product image.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 4 duplicates"
