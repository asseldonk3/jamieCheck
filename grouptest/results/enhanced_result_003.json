    "reasoning": "Algorithm A returns a more relevant and useful set for the query. The top results in A include a range of actual adult tricycles (fat-tire trike, electric trike, cargo/retro cruisers) across price points which match user intent. A shows better product variety (fat-tire, electric, classic and cargo trikes) and the top slots contain full tricycles rather than accessories. Algorithm B surfaces several accessories (large bike seat) and repeated product photos near the top, reducing immediate relevance and discoverability of distinct adult tricycles.",
    "key_differences": "A provides broader, more relevant variety of full adult tricycles in top positions (including electric and cargo options). B over-promotes accessories and repeats the same product image, lowering diversity and usefulness of the top results.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In B the large black bike seat image appears twice within the first 8 items (an exact image duplication). B also shows repeated-looking cargo/trike images clustered near the top. A's first 8 are all distinct images (no exact-photo duplicates).",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
