  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "reasoning": "B returns results that are clearly centered on backwater/terugslagklep products (multiple dedicated backflow valve units and related Dyka/backwater items), matching the query intent. Results are more relevant, show brand-specific products and appropriate product types up front. A surfaces many generic PVC fittings, drains and shower strips that are less relevant to the specific query (terugslagklep) and therefore provides lower immediate user value.",
    "key_differences": "B ranks actual terugslagklep/backwater valve units and brand-relevant items higher; A shows a mix of unrelated plumbing parts (elbows, T-pieces, drains, seals) and less query-focused variety at the top.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A the second row contains three identical images of the same Dyka inset/adaptor ring (same photo repeated across sellers). In B there are repeated grey First Plast backwater-unit images (same box image appears more than once among the top items). Duplicates appear to be same-item listings from different sellers.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 3 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
