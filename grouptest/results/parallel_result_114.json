  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Results A present a clearer, more relevant set of electric tire pumps for both car and bike: recognizable portable compressors, test‑winner styling and brand items appear at the top. The top results in A are focused on the core query (electric/portable compressors), show well‑known products and include price/retailer badges that help user decision making. Results B contains relevant items but mixes in accessories (adapters) and more niche or single items in top positions, reducing immediate user value for a generic \"Bandenpomp voor Auto en Fiets\" search.",
    "key_differences": "A ranks mainstream electric compressors and recognizable models higher (better relevance and top‑result quality); B shows a looser mix that includes accessories and smaller/less central items near the top, reducing immediate usefulness and perceived relevance.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A the same Donrox product image appears twice within the first 8 results (same photo from different listings). B's first 8 results show no exact identical images. Duplicates come from multiple sellers listing the same product image and reduce perceived variety on the results page.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
