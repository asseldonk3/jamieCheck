    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Version B returns more results that match the search intent for “Geberit UP320 Toiletmodule” — several UP320 inbouwreservoir/frame listings, complete UP320 toilet sets and matching Bedieningspanelen (flush plates) are surfaced near the top. The top results in B are more focused on the module and its common accessories, giving the user relevant choices and kit/bundle options. Version A shows a mix of relevant items but also many peripheral parts (valves, pipes, different toilet models) higher up; overall it feels noisier and less targeted to a user explicitly seeking the UP320 module.",
    "key_differences": "B emphasizes UP320 frames, complete toilet sets and matching flush plates (high relevance and useful bundle options). A surfaces more miscellaneous parts and repeat-looking images early (less focused), reducing perceived result quality and variety.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A the tall white/blue flush/valve image appears more than once in the top 8 and the blue Duofix/frame image is repeated as well. In B the top 8 show distinct images (frames, sets, and various flush plates) with no exact image repeats among the first 8.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
