  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Version B surfaces a broader and more useful mix of children's electric bikes for the query: it includes a realistic child e-bike (Avon Bx1), recognizable off-road models (Razor/RCB) and a variety of product formats (city e-bike, small e-dirtbike, balance-style bike). Top results in B are more representative of what a shopper searching for 'Kinder Elektrische fietsen' likely wants: a mix of real kid e-bikes and popular dirt/ride-on models across price points and use cases. Overall B better balances product types, expected brands and likely user value (clearer, practical e-bikes and recognizable models up top).",
    "key_differences": "B shows more varied product types (city e-bike, off-road, balance-style) and stronger commercial relevance in the top slots; A places more toy/scooter style items and less practical kid-e-bike models higher, reducing perceived relevance and variety.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Both A and B show the same Ouxi C63 fatbike image twice within the first 8 results. Other items in the first 8 are visually distinct in each version.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
