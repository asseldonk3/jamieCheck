  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Version B better matches the search intent. The query specifically asks for Cortina transport bikes with 7 speeds and 28\" wheels; the results in B are surfaced with the brand filter applied and show Cortina-style transport bikes up front, so precision for the query is higher. Top results in B are more focused on the requested brand/configuration and therefore more relevant and useful to a user specifically looking for a Cortina 7‑speed 28\" transportfiets. Although B is somewhat narrower, the top results provide higher user value for this exact query (brand match and clearly relevant models).",
    "key_differences": "A returns a wider mix of brands (Crown Holland, Altec, Amigo, Wheelerz etc.) that reduces precision for the Cortina-specific query; B is filtered/narrowed toward Cortina and the requested specs, delivering higher relevance at top positions but slightly less variety.",
    "duplicate_notes": "I observed repeated identical product photos among top results (popular transport‑bike models listed by multiple sellers). The repeated images are mainly for common models (Altec/Crown Holland style bikes and a plain black transportfiets) and occur across different sellers, which reduces visible variety in the grid and can push truly distinct models further down the page.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 3 duplicates"
