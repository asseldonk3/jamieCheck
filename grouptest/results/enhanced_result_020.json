    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.82,
    "reasoning": "Version B produces a more useful ordering for the query. The top results in B show a clearer mix of relevant mountain/MTB products (adult hardtail/trekking bikes and e‑MTBs) and include different price/condition signals (e.g. 'Refurbished' / combi‑deals) that help users quickly compare options. B also avoids repeating the same exact image in the immediate top results, improving perceived variety. Version A puts visually similar/child-oriented items and nearly identical product images higher up, which reduces perceived relevance and variety for a general \"mountainbikes / MTB\" search.",
    "key_differences": "B shows better product variety and less image repetition in the first page: more distinct adult mountain/e‑bikes and clearer deal badges. A has repetitive images of the same model and more child/road-style thumbnails up front, which lowers topical relevance and diversity.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A there is a clear repeated product image (same black/red bike appears twice in the first 8 results). No exact-image duplicates were observed in the first 8 results of B. Duplicates in A reduce variety and make scanning/comparison harder for users.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
