  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Version B surfaces more clearly relevant 'bubbelbaden' (jetted/whirlpool-style baths) in the top positions and maintains better topical consistency. Top results in B are mostly true whirlpool/bubble-bath models from recognizable product styles (built-in and freestanding whirlpools), whereas A mixes non-jetted or simple freestanding tubs among the highest ranks. B therefore offers higher immediate relevance, stronger top-result quality and a better selection for users specifically searching for bubble baths.",
    "key_differences": "B prioritizes jetted/whirlpool-style tubs and consistent product types at the top; A places a mix of non-jetted freestanding tubs and portable/novelty items earlier, reducing immediate relevance and perceived variety for the query.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact-identical product images were repeated within the first 8 results of either version. Several identical product photos do appear across the two pages (same items shown by different sellers on different positions) and further down the lists, but those repeats are outside the first 8 items inspected.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
