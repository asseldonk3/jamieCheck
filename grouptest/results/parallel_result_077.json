  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.75,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A shows more immediately relevant items for the query 'Toiletten' — a variety of actual toilet models (standing, wall-hung, bidet/seat variants) and recognizable best-sellers appear high in the grid. Results feel more focused on core product intent (toilets) and provide useful choices up-front. Algorithm B surfaces a few accessory items (flush plate, handheld bidet fitting) and repeated listings earlier in the view, which reduces top-result relevance and immediate user value.",
    "key_differences": "A prioritizes actual toilet units and a balanced mix of form factors; B includes non-toilet accessories and more repeats in prime positions, hurting relevance and perceived variety.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Both screenshots show repeated identical product photos among the first 8 results — notably the boxy cistern model (GO/VM Go X-Joy) and a pedestal/raised toilet bowl appear multiple times, suggesting duplicate listings from different sellers crowding top slots.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 4 duplicates, B has 4 duplicates"
