    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Both rankings are relevant to the query (PVC terugslagklep) and show appropriate product types, but B presents a stronger mix of useful item types and price points in the top results. B surfaces different subtypes (inline connectors/adapters, vertical valves and mid-range consumer options) within the first page, offering better coverage of likely user intents (repair, new installation, different connection types). Top results in B look more balanced across price and functional variation, improving immediate user value and discoverability of alternatives. A focuses more on a particular product style and brand in prominent positions which limits variety of useful options visible at a glance.",
    "key_differences": "B provides broader product subtype coverage and a wider spread of price points among the top results, making it easier for users to find suitable alternatives; A emphasizes similar large/brand items up front, reducing immediate variety.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In both A and B the same grey First Plast box-style check valve image appears three times within the first 8 results (counted as 2 duplicate occurrences beyond the first). Other top images are distinct; duplicates are concentrated on that single product image.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
