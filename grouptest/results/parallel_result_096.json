  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Both results are relevant to the query 'Douchedeur Strips', but version B provides a better user experience: it surfaces a wider variety of product types (adhesive strips, rubber wedges, PVC seals, premium arched profiles), shows different materials and form-factors up front, and presents a broader price range and brand mix. Top results in B give shoppers useful choices (different materials/sizes and visible premium options), whereas A focuses heavily on a single visual product style which reduces immediate choice and perceived variety. Overall B is more useful for users comparing types, sizes and price points.",
    "key_differences": "A emphasizes one dominant product appearance/brand in top slots (narrow variety); B shows a mix of materials, shapes and brands up front, giving better product diversity and choice.",
    "duplicate_notes": "A shows many repeated STEIGNER product images occupying the top results (same photo used multiple times). B has some repetition (a black adhesive wedge image and a STEIGNER image appear more than once) but overall shows more distinct product images and formats.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 6 duplicates, B has 4 duplicates"
