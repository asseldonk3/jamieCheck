  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.87,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm B ranks more directly relevant items (folding e-bikes) higher and avoids pushing an irrelevant accessory (motor kit) so prominently into early positions. B shows a broader mix of brands and models in the top results, which increases usefulness for shoppers searching specifically for 'Elektrische vouwfietsen'. A places an accessory (Keenso Hub Motor Kit) in a top slot and clusters similar models/brands together, reducing immediate relevance and diversity.",
    "key_differences": "B reduces prominence of irrelevant accessory content in the top slots and surfaces a wider variety of distinct folding-bike models and brands earlier; A has an irrelevant product in the top 3 and shows less variety among the highest positions.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact identical product photos were observed among the first 8 results in either variant. There are multiple listings of similar models and same models in different colors, but those use different images and were not counted as duplicates.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
