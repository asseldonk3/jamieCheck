  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Results in B are more aligned with the query 'IKEA Wastafelonderdelen' because the top listings surface Ikea-specific parts (e.g. Afdichting voor Ikea Atlant) and a broader selection of distinct sink parts. B shows more product variety (seals, multi-packs, OEM-style parts and strainers) and places relevant, user-intent matching items higher. A tends to show many near-identical stainless strainers first (less focused on Ikea OEM parts), which reduces relevance and perceived result quality.",
    "key_differences": "A emphasizes the same stainless sink-strainer image repeatedly (multiple sellers of the same-looking part) which reduces visible variety. B surfaces Ikea-branded/fitment parts and distinct product types near the top (black seals, multi-packs, different drain/plug types), giving more relevant and varied top results.",
    "duplicate_notes": "A has multiple exact repeats of the same stainless strainer image within the top 8 (the same product image appears 3 times), which reduces diversity. B has one clear duplicate (a two-row repeat of the same strainer image) but otherwise presents distinct images (several black Ikea-fit seals and different pack images). Duplicates in A push repeat sellers/products into prime positions, hurting discovery of different parts.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 3 duplicates, B has 1 duplicates"
