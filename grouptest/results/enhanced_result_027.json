    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both lists are relevant to the query 'Fatbikes' and surface legitimate fatbike models, but B produces a slightly better ranking. B's top results show a broader mix of distinct models and body styles in the first positions (folding fatbikes, compact fatbikes, conventional fatbikes), which increases choice for users. A places visually similar products (same model in different color variants) very near the top, reducing perceived variety. Both show competitive prices and some discount badges, but B presents a more balanced and diverse top set that is more useful for general browsing and comparison.",
    "key_differences": "B prioritizes a wider variety of distinct models in the top positions (more unique silhouettes and types), while A clusters multiple color/variant listings of the same model near the top, reducing diversity. B therefore gives better exploratory value; A emphasizes some discounted/featured items but at cost of top-result variety.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact identical product images were found within the first 8 results on either page. Several listings show the same model in different colors or from different sellers (not counted as duplicates per instructions), and some images/styles repeat elsewhere beyond the top 8.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
