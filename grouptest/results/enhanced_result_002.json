    "reasoning": "Both A and B produce very similar rankings for the broad query 'Kleding'. The top results show a good spread across categories (outerwear, socks, dresses, t‑shirts, underwear, pants, base layers, blouses), which matches user intent for a generic clothing search. Quality of top results is comparable in both: visible items are cleanly photographed, include popular everyday categories and reasonably priced options. There is no clear superiority in relevance, diversity, or user value between the two screenshots.",
    "key_differences": "No meaningful differences observed in the first viewport — ordering, item types and visual prominence are effectively the same, so neither algorithm shows a distinct advantage in ranking quality.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact identical product images within the first 8 results of either view. Further down the page there appear to be similar underwear/boxer pack images that may repeat across listings, but these repeats are not present in the top‑8 viewport used for this count.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
