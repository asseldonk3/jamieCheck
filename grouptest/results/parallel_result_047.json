    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both results are relevant to the query 'Radiatorombouwen' (all top results are radiator covers), but version B provides slightly better user value and ordering. B surfaces a clear budget/popular item (vidaXL black ladder-style) higher in the list, shows a visible discounted product in the top results, and overall places a mix of styles and price points earlier â€” which helps users quickly compare popular and good-value options. A contains relevant items too but places some high-value/cheap items further down and repeats a large white cover image within the top results, reducing immediate variety.",
    "key_differences": "B ranks a low-cost/popular model and a discounted item higher (better value-first ordering) and delivers slightly more useful variety up front. A emphasizes a best-seller badge but repeats a large white cover image within the top 8, slightly reducing perceived diversity.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In both A and B there is one exact image repetition among the first 8 items (A repeats a large white slatted cover; B repeats the same staged white cover image). Duplicates appear to be the same product photos listed by different sellers and reduce the distinct options visible in the immediate results.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 1 duplicates, B has 1 duplicates"
