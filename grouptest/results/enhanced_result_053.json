    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both pages are clearly on-topic for the query ‘Douchecabines’, but B presents a stronger mix of product types, styles and price points in the top results which better serves different user intents (compact corner cabins, full enclosures, premium models). B’s top results feel more varied and visually informative, with a clearer spread of popular models and sizes; A’s top area is relevant but less balanced in terms of form factors and price segmentation. Overall B gives users better exploratory value and quicker access to a range of reasonable purchase options.",
    "key_differences": "B shows greater product variety and a broader selection of cabin types and price points near the top (better coverage of user intents). A’s ranking is more clustered around a narrower set of styles/prices in the top slots, reducing immediate variety for the shopper.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A the identical white rectangular cabin photo appears twice within the first 8 results (two items share the same image). In B there are multiple repeated product photos among the first 8 (notably the curved/semi-circular cabin and at least one other image reused across sellers), resulting in about 3 items that are image-duplicates in the top 8.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 3 duplicates"
