  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.76,
    "reasoning": "Both pages surface relevant double panniers for the query 'Giant Twist Fietstas', but version B orders more clearly bike-focused, well-known pannier models and recognisable brands (Ortlieb and several dedicated double panniers) higher in the grid. Both results still show some noise (an unrelated charger/adapter appears prominently in position 1 on both), but B gives slightly better immediate value to a shopper by putting recognizable pannier styles and higher-quality brand options earlier.",
    "key_differences": "B places more bike-specific panniers and stronger-brand items higher (better top-result quality and perceived trust), while A shows more mixed relevance at the very top (non-pannier accessory ranked highly) and slightly less clear prioritization of popular/brand items.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact-image duplicates detected among the first 8 results on either page. Several similar product types (double panniers in black) appear, but they use distinct product photos (different models/angles).",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
