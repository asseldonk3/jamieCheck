    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Both lists return highly relevant Ortlieb fietstassen items, but B gives a stronger mix of distinct Ortlieb models and colours up front (Back‑Roller Plus in different colours, bike‑packer, handlebar bag) which improves perceived variety and choice. B’s top results surface popular models and sensible alternatives, helping users compare variants and find good deals. A is relevant but shows several repeated product images among the top results which reduces perceived variety and usefulness of the top results.",
    "key_differences": "B orders a broader set of distinct Ortlieb models in the top positions (more colour/shape variety, clear popular items). A repeats identical product images within the first rows (same panniers shown multiple times), which reduces apparent diversity and wastes prime real estate.",
    "duplicate_notes": "A shows at least two identical yellow double‑pannier images and two identical black Back‑Roller/Core images among the first 8 results (same photo from different sellers). B has fewer exact-image repeats — the most apparent duplicate is the teal Back‑Roller image appearing twice in the top 8.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 4 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
