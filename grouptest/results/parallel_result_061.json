  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.82,
    "reasoning": "Version B produces more relevant and useful rankings for the query 'Douchecabines'. B's top results are actual shower cabins (recognizable models, brands and complete units) and present a clearer variety of cabin styles and configurations. Version A shows an irrelevant accessory (mixer valve) high in the results and repeats a stylized product image (line-drawing) early, which harms relevance and perceived quality. Overall B surfaces better, on-topic products and stronger top results for a typical shopper.",
    "key_differences": "B ranks actual shower cabins and recognizable brand models higher and avoids non-cabin accessories in the top slots; A includes an irrelevant accessory among the top items and has repeated identical product images early, reducing diversity and usefulness of the first page.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Both variants show an identical 'Linie Cadiz' line-drawing image repeated within the first 8 results. A also repeats a stylized/catalog image early. Duplicates consume prime real estate and reduce visible variety for users.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
