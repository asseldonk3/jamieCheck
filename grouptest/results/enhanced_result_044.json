  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both results contain the correct product type (PVC terugslagkleppen with inspection/cleaning covers) but version B ranks a highly relevant grey inspection/check-valve image at #1 while offering more visual variety in the immediate results. A places the same grey valve image twice at the very top (positions 1â€“2), which reduces useful diversity for the shopper and pushes other relevant alternatives slightly down. B's top results provide a better mix of relevant valve types and price points and therefore deliver higher user value.",
    "key_differences": "Algorithm A repeats the same prominent grey check-valve image at the top (low diversity); Algorithm B spaces similar items out and shows a more varied set of relevant products in the top positions, improving exploration and user value.",
    "duplicate_notes": "The large grey First Plast inspection/check-valve image appears multiple times across the results (in A at positions 1 and 2; in B at positions 1, 3 and again at 8). This repetition reduces perceived variety; a few other product images (orange backwater valve, shower strips, drains) repeat elsewhere on the page but those repeats are outside or just beyond the first 8 in one list.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 1 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
