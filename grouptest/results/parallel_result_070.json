    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.78,
    "reasoning": "Both pages surface relevant frost-free outdoor taps, but A places more actual frost-free tap models and technical variants in the top positions. A's top results are product-focused (various frost-free wall/flush-mount taps and a technical Polar drawing) and show a broader range of core tap types and brands. B's top results include more accessories and one garden pedestal/column which is less directly aligned with a user searching specifically for 'vorstvrije/antivries/vorstbestendige buitenkranen'. Overall A offers slightly better immediate relevance and higher user value in the top results (more tap models, clearer price/offer presentation).",
    "key_differences": "A emphasizes core frost-free tap models and technical variants in the first page positions; B includes more accessories and a garden column among the top results, reducing topical precision and immediate user value.",
    "duplicate_notes": "While the first 8 items on both pages contain no identical product images, the full page shows repeated product photos across different sellers (e.g., the same VSH/twin-copper tap photo and the plastic key handle image appear multiple times elsewhere). These exact-image repeats are used by different shops and can reduce perceived variety and make comparison harder when they appear high in results.",
