    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both A and B return very relevant results for the query 'Douchewanden' (glass shower walls/panels). B ranks a simple, affordable walk-in panel (Wiesbaden) prominently and mixes several distinct product types (walk-in panels, framed sliding door, mid-priced enclosures) within the top positions, giving better coverage of common user intents (budget walk-in panel, framed sliding solution, compact enclosure). A is relevant as well but places heavier emphasis on larger framed/sliding doors and shows less variety among the immediate top results. Overall B provides a slightly better mix of styles and price points at the top which improves immediate user value.",
    "key_differences": "B has a more balanced top set (affordable walk-in panels plus varied styles/prices). A leans more toward framed/sliding doors near the top and fewer distinct visual styles in the first rows.",
    "duplicate_notes": "While the first 8 items on both pages are all visually unique, identical product images (not counted above) do appear further down the lists â€” notably a dark-tiled frosted-strip panel image is repeated at least twice on the page and some sliding-door / framed images recur elsewhere. Duplicates appear to be the same item offered by multiple shops and are located outside the first 8 shown here.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
