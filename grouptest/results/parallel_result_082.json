  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.82,
    "reasoning": "Version A shows a more balanced and relevant top set for the query “E-bike Fietskratten en Manden”: it surfaces multiple basket types (handlebar mesh baskets, wire baskets, carry-all pannier-style bags and dog carriers) and visible best‑seller/discount cues. The top results in A feel more diverse and useful to shoppers looking for different basket solutions. Version B repeats the same carry-all image within the top results, includes a refurbished tag and a mounting accessory at high rank which reduces immediate relevance and variety for a user wanting baskets/crates.",
    "key_differences": "A offers greater product variety and fewer repeated images in the top slots, producing more useful and relevant choices immediately. B shows a repeated carry-all image inside the first 8 and places non-basket accessories (mounting hardware/refurbished items) more prominently, decreasing perceived variety and user value.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In both pages there is one duplicate image pair within the first 8 results (A: the same Basil mesh basket appears twice; B: the same Basil carry-all bag appears twice). These duplicates reduce visible variety and push other relevant items lower in the listing.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
