  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both views show mostly accessories rather than full electric bicycles, but B provides a broader and more useful mix of bike-related items in the top positions (bike listing + drivetrain parts + lighting + brake pads) whereas A places many near-identical accessory listings (display pouches) prominently. B therefore offers better relevance, more useful variety for a shopper searching “Elektrische Fiets,” and higher practical user value (more varied components and deal/price signals visible near the top).",
    "key_differences": "B surfaces a wider variety of bike parts and accessories in the top results (increased product diversity) while A repeats similar accessory types near the top (many display/pouch listings), reducing perceived relevance and variety.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Both pages show repeated identical product images for the same accessory sold by multiple shops. A shows repeated Bosch/ebike display pouches within the top results; B shows a clearly repeated grey kwmobile pouch image in the first eight. Repeats reduce perceived variety and can hurt the browsing experience.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
