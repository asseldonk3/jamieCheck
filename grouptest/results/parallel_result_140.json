    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "For the broad query 'Sanitair' version A provides a better mix of relevant product types (faucets, showers, valves, boilers and toilets) in the top results. Top items include recognizable category leaders and best‑seller items and show price/offer information — giving users quick access to popular and valuable choices. The ranking feels more balanced for a general sanitary-products search.",
    "key_differences": "A surfaces a more diverse set of categories in the top slots (mix of faucets, showers, toilets, boilers and fittings) while B clusters shower cabins near the top, reducing category variety. A therefore better serves a broad query; B would be reasonable for a user specifically searching for showers but is less useful for general exploration.",
    "duplicate_notes": "I observed an identical black-framed shower cabin image appearing twice within the first 8 results of A (same product image from different sellers). Overall, the catalogue shows repeated identical images for the same shower cabins and small boilers across sellers, causing visible duplication on the results grid.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
