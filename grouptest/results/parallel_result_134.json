    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both result sets are relevant to the query 'Badkamer Doorstroomboilers' (they show instant/tankless water heaters and shower-compatible units), but B produces a stronger top-8: it shows a broader variety of distinct models and places higher-quality-looking, full-featured units (visible displays and compact bathroom-friendly designs) more prominently. B avoids repeating the same product photo in the immediate top results, which keeps the first page more useful. Overall B gives more diversity and clearer product choices for a shopper deciding on a bathroom instant heater.",
    "key_differences": "B has better product variety and ordering in the top positions (more distinct models and placements of higher-value units). A repeats an identical seller image within the top results, reducing perceived variety and pushing fewer unique options into visible positions.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A the small white instantaneous shower-heater image (unit + hose/showerhead) appears twice among the top 8 (exact same photo from different sellers). No exact image duplicates found within the first 8 in B. Several products across both screenshots are visually similar but not identical (different models, colors or viewpoints).",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
