    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both pages are relevant to the query (Selle Royal saddles) and show brand-filtered results, but A produces slightly better top-of-page results: it surfaces a variety of popular Selle Royal models in the top ranks (including the Respiro and Loire models) and shows a clearer mix of price points and 'best seller' items. That gives users useful choices immediately (popular models, different price tiers). B is also relevant but places some mid-range or similar models in the top slots in a way that feels slightly less optimized for immediate user value (fewer clearly distinct top picks and some less prominent listings pushed up).",
    "key_differences": "A emphasizes well-known/popular models and a clearer spread of price/utility in the top results; B has a similar set of items but the ordering gives less immediate diversity among the very top slots and includes listings (e.g. partner/Amazon item) that are not clearly higher value for most users.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Within the first 8 results of both screenshots I did not observe any identical product images repeated. There are many visually-similar Selle Royal models (same model in different colors/views) across the pages, but no exact duplicate photos in the top 8 of either version.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
