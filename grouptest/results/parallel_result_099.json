  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both pages surface relevant small handlebar bags, but B orders higher-quality, well-known brands (VAUDE, Deuter, Klickfix) near the top whereas A leads with a very cheap, low-end-looking bag. B's top results are more useful for a typical shopper seeking a 'kleine stuurtas' (better recognizability, perceived quality and popularity). A shows more bargain-first placements which can be useful for price-driven shoppers but reduces perceived relevance and trust for general users.",
    "key_differences": "B prioritizes branded, higher-quality and recognizable products in the top slots; A prioritizes a low-price deal first. B therefore gives stronger signal of relevance and user value (brand, perceived durability), while A emphasizes cheapest-first which harms top-result quality for typical users.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Within the first eight results on each page there are no exact identical product images repeated. Some similar models/brands appear across the two pages, but no identical image duplicates were observed among the top 8 on either version.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
