    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm B presents a broader mix of distinct Basil MIK models in the top results (City, Forte, Discovery, GO, Flair) whereas A places several visually similar City-style items (color variants) near the top. B therefore provides better coverage of user intent for the query “Basil Fietstassen MIK”, higher product variety and more useful top results (different form factors and price points visible earlier).",
    "key_differences": "A tends to cluster similar City-style panniers (including color variants) at the top, reducing variety. B surfaces a wider set of models and styles among the first results, improving discovery and user value.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact identical product photos were visible within the first 8 results of either view. Several near-duplicates are color variants or different angles of the same model (these were not counted as duplicates per the instructions). Some identical images appear elsewhere outside the first 8 in the grid, but not in the top 8.",
