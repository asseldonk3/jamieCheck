    "confidence": 0.82,
    "reasoning": "Both result sets are relevant to the query 'Dames Elektrische fietsen' and primarily show step-through city e-bikes (appropriate for women’s electric bikes). Version B edges out A because the top results mix price points and user-value signals more visibly (a premium model, affordable/basket models, and a clearly marked best-seller) which helps a broader set of user intents (premium searchers, deal-seekers, and practical commuters). A leans more toward several visually similar grey city/commuter bikes in the top positions, reducing perceived variety among the most prominent results.",
    "key_differences": "B shows more visible variety and user-value cues in the immediate top results (best-seller badge, a bargain/entry model and basket commuter options), while A’s top ranks are more visually and stylistically similar (several grey city/commuter bikes), which can make it harder for users to quickly find distinct options.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact identical product images within the first 8 results of either variant. However, identical images (same product from different sellers) do appear elsewhere on the page outside the top 8 (e.g., the Puch E-Modern and some Puch/Puch-similar city models and basket models appear multiple times across the grid), which can reduce perceived catalog variety and waste result space when present.",
