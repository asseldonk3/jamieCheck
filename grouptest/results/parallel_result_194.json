  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Result set B is more relevant to the query 'Flexibele Afvoerslang Sanitair' â€” the top results are mostly different types of flexible drain hoses (various materials and shapes) and show clearer, product-focused images. A returns a number of less-relevant large items (e.g. freestanding baths, urinals, folding bath) among the top results which reduces relevance and usefulness for someone searching specifically for flexible drain hoses. B also provides better variety within the hose category (metal, PVC, accordion, S-shaped) which helps users compare options quickly.",
    "key_differences": "A mixes in unrelated sanitary items and kits in the top results, lowering precision; B concentrates on hose products and presents a broader set of hose types and price points near the top, improving both relevance and user value.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In B the same grey S-shaped flexible hose image appears twice in the first 8 results (a clear exact-image duplicate). In A there are no exact-image duplicates in the first 8. Additional identical black coiled hose images are visible further down in B (outside the first 8).",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 1 duplicates"
