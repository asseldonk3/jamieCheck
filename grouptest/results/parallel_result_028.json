  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both lists are relevant for the query 'Glazen Douchewanden' (they show glass shower panels and enclosures), but B provides a slightly better mix of product types and perceived user value in the top positions: it surfaces a walk-in corner panel, a sliding door, a full enclosure and frameless panels within the very top results, giving users a broader set of common use cases immediately. B also places recognizable / higher-value items near the top and shows a clearer spread of price points and enclosure styles, which helps users who are browsing for inspiration or comparing formats.",
    "key_differences": "B shows greater immediate variety in the top results (walk-in panels, sliding doors, full enclosures) and better price/format spread. A clusters similar product types higher up and places some lower-utility images (e.g., product-room photos) earlier, reducing immediate diversity.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In both A and B the same frosted-panel image set in a dark-tiled background appears twice within the first 8 results (identical product photo shown by different sellers). No other exact image duplicates were visible in the top 8 of either list.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
