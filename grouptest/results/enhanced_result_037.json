  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Result set B is more directly relevant to the query 'Hema Zijwieltjes' — the top results in B predominantly show actual training wheels (packaged sets, branded items and best‑seller badges) and a coherent selection of related wheel products. A returns many non-relevant items in the top positions (casters, bearings, gear parts and other hardware) which reduces relevance and usefulness for a user searching specifically for Hema training wheels.",
    "key_differences": "B is more focused on training wheels and presents recognizable product images and shopping signals (packaging, badges, brand items) near the top. A shows higher variety but much of it is off‑query (industrial casters, bearings, gears), reducing top‑result quality and user value.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In the first 8 results of both views I observed no identical product images. Outside the first 8 (especially in B further down) there are a few repeating training‑wheel images from different sellers, but the top 8 are all unique in each view.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
