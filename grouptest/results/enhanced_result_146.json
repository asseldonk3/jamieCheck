  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "reasoning": "Results in B are more relevant to the query 'Action Fietsstandaards' â€” the top items are actual bicycle kickstands/centre stands with clear product images, seller badges and recognizable offerings. A returns many small pads, motorcycle sidestand enlargers and unrelated sprocket imagery in top slots, which reduces relevance and user value for someone looking for bike stands.",
    "key_differences": "B prioritizes actual bicycle stands (side stands, centre stands, double-leg stands) and shows more useful, purchase-ready items at the top. A surfaces many accessory pads and sprocket images (including repeated non-stand images), reducing relevance and variety of useful results.",
    "duplicate_notes": "In A the AFAM sprocket image appears at least twice among the first 8 results. In B there are duplicate Decathlon single-leg stand images appearing more than once in the top 8. Overall duplicates are present but not pervasive in either set.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
