    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.88,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A returns a higher proportion of actual mid-motor e-bikes in the top results, showing a variety of full-bike listings and recognizable consumer models (Vogue, Altec, Puch, SachsenRAD). Top slots in A are relevant to the query, include popular models and visible price/compare labels that help user value decisions. Algorithm B surfaces more non-bike items (chains/chainrings/accessory packaging) and repeats identical product images among the top slots, which reduces relevance and immediate user value for someone searching specifically for “E-bike met Middenmotor.”",
    "key_differences": "A favors full e-bike listings with more model variety and user-relevant signals up front; B mixes bike parts/accessories into top positions and shows repeated identical images, reducing perceived relevance and variety.",
    "duplicate_notes": "A shows one repeated bike image within the first 8 (same Vogue listing image across sellers). B has two duplicates in the first 8: the KMC chain-pack image appears twice and a Vogue black bike image repeats, reducing unique bike exposures and increasing noise from parts/accessories.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 1 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
