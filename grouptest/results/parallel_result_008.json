  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Results in B show stronger relevance and higher perceived product quality for the query 'Fietstassen' â€” recognizable, higher-end brands (Ortlieb, EVOC) and a mix of functional shapes/colors appear near the top, which improves user trust and choice. B also presents better product variety across brand, style and use (commuting vs. touring) in the top positions. A is relevant but feels more focused on generic/budget options and lacks some of the clear premium brand presence and variety visible in B's top results.",
    "key_differences": "B prioritizes higher-recognition brands and a broader mix of styles near the top (better perceived quality and user value). A surfaces more generic/budget-style panniers early, giving less brand variety and slightly lower perceived top-result quality.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact identical product images were repeated within the first 8 listings on either page. Several identical product photos appear across the two pages (same items shown in A and B), but they are not duplicated within a single page's top 8.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
