    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A surfaces a stronger mix of highly relevant items for 'Ophang Fietsenrekken en Opbergbeugels' â€” visible ceiling bike lifts, multi-bike racks and a clear premium wall-storage product. The top items in A include popular/best-seller style products with clear hero images of bikes on the hoists which improves immediate relevance and user trust. Overall A provides better top-result quality and clearer user value (recognizable lift systems, multi-bike racks and price/retailer links).",
    "key_differences": "A emphasizes full bike-lift systems and multi-bike storage with clearer hero images and best-seller cues; B shows more single-purpose hooks and bracket variants that are visually similar and less diverse at the top.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact-identical product images were observed among the first 8 results on either page. There are visually similar bracket/hook photos across the listings (and some repeated product types farther down), but no identical image duplicates within the top 8 of A or B.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
