  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Result set B shows higher relevance to the query 'Radiatoren' because its top results are actual radiators (design radiators, electric/infrared panels, towel radiators) and recognizable brands, giving users immediate access to likely intent matches. B also presents better variety across radiator types and price points in the top positions, improving user choice and perceived value. A places several radiator covers and similar-looking items higher, which reduces immediate relevance and variety for a user searching specifically for radiators.",
    "key_differences": "B surfaces a broader mix of radiator types and stronger brand/value signals in top slots (design radiators, electric panels, towel rails). A favors radiator covers/ombouw and more visually similar white-panel items early, decreasing topical relevance and perceived diversity.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Within the first 8 items on each page there are no identical product photos. However, the same product images (e.g., Uranus design radiator, Oppio ladder, Designradiator Ella) reappear across the two result sets and elsewhere on the pages, indicating multi-seller listings and repeated stock photos beyond the top-8 region.",
