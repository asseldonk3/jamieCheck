    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm A produces more relevant top results for the query 'Dames Fietshelmen' — it prioritizes common women's/urban helmets (popular ABUS commuter models and other city helmets) and shows recognizable best-seller items and deals up top. The results look more focused on everyday women’s helmets rather than mixing in unrelated segments. Algorithm B shows a few high-end or niche sport helmets and even a clearly child-themed helmet in the top results, which reduces relevance for a women's helmet search. Overall A gives better immediate user value and relevance.",
    "key_differences": "A concentrates on popular city/commuter helmets and best-sellers (higher immediate relevance and perceived value). B has more model variety but includes some less-relevant items (child helmet, premium sport helmets) near the top, reducing precision for the query.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Multiple listings reuse the same ABUS product images (the Abus Urban/I3.0 style appears more than once). Duplicates are moderate in the top 8 for both variants, reducing visible variety and occupying valuable prime result space.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 2 duplicates, B has 2 duplicates"
