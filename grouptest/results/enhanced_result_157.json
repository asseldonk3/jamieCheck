  "analysis": {
    "winner": "A",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "Both pages return relevant inner tubes, but A orders slightly more useful items higher (a boxed product and clear product-shot tube up front) and shows a bit more variety in the top positions. The top results in A are more clearly product listings (box + tube) which aids quick selection; B surfaces more repeated tube close-ups in the top slots and also places a non-tube accessory (blue strap) among the first three, reducing immediate relevance. Overall A gives a marginally better balance of relevance and top-result quality for the query.",
    "key_differences": "A has fewer identical tube images in the top results and shows more distinct product types early (boxed units, different variants). B repeats the same black tube photo more often in the first 8, reducing visual diversity and making the top results feel more redundant.",
    "duplicate_notes": "The black curved tube close-up (GAADI logo on tip) repeats multiple times on both pages (3x in A, 4x in B within the first 8). Several green GAADI box shots appear too but they are different crops/variants rather than exact image duplicates. B shows a stronger repetition of the exact tube photo, lowering variety in the visible results.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 3 duplicates, B has 4 duplicates"
