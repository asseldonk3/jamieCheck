  "analysis": {
    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.75,
    "reasoning": "Both pages perform poorly for the query 'Riese Und M端ller Fietsaccessoires' because neither surfaces clear Riese & M端ller branded items in the top results. Between the two, B gives marginally better user value: its top results show a slightly broader mix of accessory types (mounts/brackets, helmets, bike computer) and fewer similar helmet models clustered at the very top, which increases the chance a user finds a relevant accessory quickly. B's top placements also include clear price/discount badges and recognizable accessory items which improves immediate scannability and perceived relevance.",
    "key_differences": "A emphasizes many helmets from the same brand family in the top positions (less visible variety), whereas B spreads different accessory categories more evenly among the first results. B therefore provides slightly better diversity and scan-ability in the top results; neither version, however, matches the brand-specific intent of the query.",
    "duplicate_notes": "No exact identical product images appear more than once within the first 8 results of either page. Many items are visually similar (multiple Abus helmets) but they are different images/models and were not counted as duplicates.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
