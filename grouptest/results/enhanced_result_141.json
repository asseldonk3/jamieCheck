    "winner": "B",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "reasoning": "Algorithm B returns results that are much more relevant to the query 'Bevestigingsset voor Wc-Brillen' (mounting/fastening sets for toilet seats). The top results in B include bolts, fixing kits and replacement fastening parts â€” the items a user searching for a bevestigingsset would expect. Algorithm A surfaces many complete toilet seats (covers/seats) and branded seats near the top, which are less relevant to a user explicitly looking for fixing/mounting sets. B also provides better product variety within the desired subcategory (different types of fixings, price points and kit compositions), which increases immediate user value.",
    "key_differences": "Main difference is relevance: B prioritizes actual fastening kits and hardware (high relevance), while A prioritizes full toilet seats and branded seat listings (low relevance). B shows better diversity of fastening parts and sensible top results for this query; A shows many similar product types (toilet seats) up front.",
    "duplicate_notes": "Within the first 8 results of both screenshots I did not find any exact identical product photos. There are many visually similar white toilet-seat images across the pages (different angles/brands) but no exact image duplicates in the top 8 of either A or B.",
    "duplicates_comparison": "A has 0 duplicates, B has 0 duplicates"
